Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: No, because "title" and "category" have the same data type which is String, then 2 constructor methods will have the same signature and this is not allowed in JAVA.
