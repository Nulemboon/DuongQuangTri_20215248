1. Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts? 
Cart is an aggregate of Media. Store is an aggregate of Media. CompactDisc is an aggregate of Track.

2.  If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens? 
If the passing object is not an instance of Media, the equals() method will return false. (instanceof)

3. Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe what happens and explain in detail.
The code will print to screen the class type of Media m (DVD, CD, Book) + the hashcode of m.

4. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Class Media should implement

5. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want? 
Since the rule of compareTo() method is return negative for less than. 0 for equal and positive for larger than, we can change the code base on that rule for the order that we want

6.Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 
 No, since the Comparable interface can compare inside the class only and can only be implemented only by class Media.
7. We can override the compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc class.
